# Python 3: Fibonacci series up to n
>>> def fib(n):
>>>   a, b = 0, 1
>>>   while a < n:
>>>     print(a, end=' ')
>>>     a, b = b, a+b
>>>   print()
>>> fib(1000)
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987
```

# Functions Defined
The core of extensible programming is defining functions. Python allows mandatory and optional arguments, keyword arguments, and even arbitrary argument lists. [More about defining functions in Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions)
  * ```
# Python 3: List comprehensions
>>> fruits = ['Banana', 'Apple', 'Lime']
>>> loud_fruits = [fruit.upper() for fruit in fruits]
>>> print(loud_fruits)
['BANANA', 'APPLE', 'LIME']
# List and the enumerate function
>>> list(enumerate(fruits))
[(0, 'Banana'), (1, 'Apple'), (2, 'Lime')]
```

# Compound Data Types
Lists (known as arrays in other languages) are one of the compound data types that Python understands. Lists can be indexed, sliced and manipulated with other built-in functions. [More about lists in Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists)
  * ```
# Python 3: Simple arithmetic
>>> 1 / 2
0.5
>>> 2 ** 3
8
>>> 17 / 3 # classic division returns a float
5.666666666666667
>>> 17 // 3 # floor division
5
```

# Intuitive Interpretation
Calculations are simple with Python, and expression syntax is straightforward: the operators `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` work as expected; parentheses `()` can be used for grouping. [More about simple math functions in Python 3](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#using-python-as-a-calculator).
  * ```
# For loop on a list
>>> numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]
>>> product = 1
>>> for number in numbers:
...  product = product * number
... 
>>> print('The product is:', product)
The product is: 384
```

# All the Flow You’d Expect
Python knows the usual control flow statements that other languages speak — `if`, `for`, `while` and `range` — with some of its own twists, of course. [More control flow tools in Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html)
  * ```
# Simple output (with Unicode)
>>> print("Hello, I'm Python!")
Hello, I'm Python!
# Input, assignment
>>> name = input('What is your name?\n')
What is your name?
Python
>>> print(f'Hi, {name}.')
Hi, Python.

```

# Quick & Easy to Learn
Experienced programmers in any other language can pick up Python very quickly, and beginners find the clean syntax and indentation structure easy to learn. [Whet your appetite](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) with our Python 3 overview.
